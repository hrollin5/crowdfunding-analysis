# Crowdfunding Analysis

In this project, I added conditional formatting, created several new variables, created several pivot tables and charts, and calculated summary statistics to gain insight from the provided data.

My analysis is included in the Word doc and in the Summary_Statistics sheet of the workbook.


##### Feedback on Assignment
###### "Hi Haley, great job on the assignment. Conditional formatting has been applied properly to %_funded and outcome columns. Moreover, all pivot & non-pivot tables and their reflected charts have been created correctly with the correct filters. Furthermore, the statical analysis part using the measures of central tendency/dispersion has been done properly. Lastly, your report is comprehensive where you listed several valid conclusions and stated some data limitations along with suggestions for additional tables/graphs. Keep it up! CG - MB"
